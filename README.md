# Understanding Blockchains by Coding One in R
###### Implement a small blockchain in R and learn more about what a blockchain looks like and some of the core concepts behind it!

Last week I came across this article on R bloggers, where BigData Doc builds a blockchain entirely in R. A blockchain built in R might not be the most efficient and practical thing in the world but it is a great way to understand the programming and crypto principles behind it. I wanted to understand it as well and that's why I implemented a smaller version of the blockchain in R: "If you can code it, you certainly understand it".

## What is a blockchain?
Let's take a look at how blockchains are making use of cryptography to become virtually un-hackable.

1. Blocks
2. Hash
3. Proof-of-Work
4. Adding new blocks
5. Building the Blockchain

## Wrap up
In this little post, you created the tiniest blockchain. The main goal was to introduce how a blockchain looks like and introduce some of the core concepts behind it.
